# image-to-ss14-writing

An image to SS14 writing (colored BBCode art) converter as a web app hosted on github.

The image converting code is [written](https://github.com/Compilatron144/image-to-ss14-writing) by **Compilatron144** in Python. Adapted to JS with fancy schmancy stuffs around it by me.
